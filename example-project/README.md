# Example Golang Project

###### Mikel Nelson (3/2016)
Example golang project to start with.

## HOW TO CREATE YOUR PROJECT FROM THIS COPY
### Step 1 - Copy The Contents to Your Repository
This example project is designed to be copied directly into your base repository directory, .i.e., the contents of this 
directory should be copied to your `github.com/samsung-cnct/<my project>`.  You do not want to create this as a 
subdirectory of your repository. e.g. `github.com/samsung-cnct/<my project>/example-proj`

NOTE: If you installed golang and go tools(glide) on your mac, the `GOPATH` base directory of your
project should be a different path from your mac's `GOPATH` so that linux go tools will work, and to keep linux binaries
separate from OSX binaries.

### Step 2 - Fix the Names and Paths in build.sh
There are three locations in the file `build.sh` that you must edit to correct for your repository name and 
relative depth. These locations are marked with `ATTENTON!`.  The comments in `build.sh` explain this also.

### Step 3 - Fix the Makefile
* You must change the `VERSION` to match your version scheme.
* You must change the `DOCKER_IMAGE` to match you project executable/container name.
* It is recommended that you do NOT change `DEFAULT_REPO` and require anyone building this to 
set `DOCKER_REPO` in their environment variables, e.g., `export DOCKER_REPO=quay.io/myaccnt`

### Step 4 - Fix make.golang
`make.golang` is the real Makefile for the app. You will add your path's targets to this file as needed.
It is a starting point. The following should be initially updated:

* `VERSION` should be set to your version
* `IMAGE_NAME` should be set to your desired app name
* Rename `apkg` to your first package name.

### Step 5
Change the value `example` to that of your app's name in 

* `_containerize/Makefile`
* `_containerize/Dockerfile`

In addition, rename `_containerize/example-demo.yaml` to your app's name.

### Step 6
Rename `apkg` directory to your first package name. Fix the references to `apkg` in the corresponding golang code.

### Step 7
Add any needed `cobra` command lines to the `/cmd` directory. However, you should implement the actual 
command logic in one of your packages, and have the cmds reference the other package, i.e., you should 
not implement the logic directly in the `/cmd` source files if you can avoid it.

### Step 8
The `main` package is `main.go` at the root level of your project. 
The file should not need many changes as most ways to execute your application will run through the `cobra` `/cmd` 
directory code. The main file just directs the processing to the cmd package.

### Final Step - Correct/Update These Files
You should update/correct `README.md` and `DEVELOPMENT.md` as needed, correcting names, etc. You should also delete 
this whole **HOW TO CREATE YOUR PROJECT FROM THIS COPY** section here.
## END OF HOW TO CREATE YOUR PROJECT SECTION

## Purpose
The project here is presented to be a source of a framework that can be used to populate a new golang project repo. As 
such, it is not runnable as is. You must copy all the content here into your repo and rename items appropriately.

## Summary
The goal is to have this "*go get-able*" so it is usable as a template by other golang projects.

## Build
This is setup to use a golang docker container to do all golang "go" commands. The current directory is mounted into 
the container, but at a location that facilitates "*go get*". 

## Dependency Management
The hope is to use whatever the current best practice dependency manager is. However, at the time of this 
update (1/2017) managing the dependencies in /vendor by hand and checking them in to source control 
was determined to be the most reliable.  

DEPRECATED BELOW...but may be relavent again:
It has been determined to use [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) as the package management tools. A special 
docker golang build image has been created 
(see [samsung-cnct/golang-tools/goglide-container](https://github.com/samsung-cnct/golang-tools/tree/master/goglide-container)).

## Management of main and cmd packages 
The golang *main* and *cmd* pkgs are built using the [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) pkg. Additions to *cmd* 
may be made by hand, or with the *cobra* template generator CLI.

### Directory Setup
**IMPORTANT**
 
When doing development, the git repository HAS to be set up as follows:

````
$(GOPATH)/src/github.com/samsung-cnct/<your project>
````
How to:

````
$ export GOPATH=<whatever base path you want>
$ cd $(GOPATH)
$ mkdir -p src/github.com/samsung-cnct
$ cd src/github.com/samsung-cnct
$ git clone <your fork of samsung-cnct/<your project>>
````
golang build results:

````
$(GOPATH)
         /bin
         /pkg
         /doc
         /src <see above>
         /src/github.com/samsung-cnct/<your project>/vendor <managed by glide or whatever dependency manager is in vogue>
````

#### Build
Prerequisites: docker running on your machine. (os-x docker, docker-machine, boot2docker, etc)

Build execution:

````
<user> +--> Makefile
       |       |
       or      |
       |       v
       +--> build.sh --- --kube ----+
               |                    |
               |                    |
               v                    v
             make.golang  _containerize/Makefile
             
````

* `make.golang` - The actual golang builder.
* `_containerize/Makefile` - Builds the docker image.
* `build.sh` - Sets up the environment and starts the golang container. Builds can be run directly from this 
script, the `--kube` arg directs arguments to the `_containerized/Makefile`.
* `Makefile` - Facade to allow running `build.sh` via a `make` command instead (when using defaults of `build.sh`) .
(NOTE: This only works with `make.golang`, not with `_containerize/Makefile`), e.g.,  `make test` == `./build.sh -- test`.

##### build.sh

````
> Runs a golang build docker container and runs Makefile
> 
> Usage:
> ./build.sh [flags] -- [Makefile Args]
>
> Flags:
> -f, --file :: golang make file name (make.golang)
> -h, -?, --help :: print usage
> -i, --int :: start an interactive shell
> -k, --kube :: route Makefile args to container build
> -m, --machine :: VM machine name, overrides DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME (gexample-build)
> -t, -test :: Test Docker Detection
> -v, --version :: print script verion
> -vv, --verbose :: more debug

> Env Vars:
> DOCKER_MACHINE_DRIVER :: (virtualbox) [optional]
> DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME :: (gexample-build) or set via argument [optional]
> 
````
##### make.golang

Targets:

* `test`
* `doc`
* `build-app` - builds linux version into `_containerize` directory
* `build-darwin` - builds os-x verion into `$GOPATH/bin` directory
* `view-all-coverage` - creates the test coverage files:
	* `./coverage-all.out`
	* `./coverage-all.html` 

Dependency Management (**if /vendor dir is not checked-in**):
* `dep` - currently not implemented
* `dep-update` - currently not implemented
* `dep-update-quick` - currently not implemented

Minor Targets
* `vet`
* `lint`

#### Local golang Packages

* `main.go`
* `./cmd/` (CLI managed by corbra)
* `./apkg`
* `/vendor` (if using vendor to manage external packages) 

### Initial Development Setup
* Create the dev area and clone the repo (outlined above)
* Fill the vendor directory with the needed dependencies: `make dep` **(ONLY IF VENDOR IS NOT CHECKED-IN)**
* Validate it is all setup correctly: `make test`
* go documents: `make doc`
* Create os-x runnable app: `make build-darwin`
* Create app for docker image: `make build-app`
* Create and push docker image: `build.sh --kube -- all push`
